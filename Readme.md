# Project Surge URL: tiy-thomas-sc_api.surge.sh

This is a basic template for starting projects.

## Objectives

- Sign up to SoundCloud for Developers and get an API key
- Using the wireframe attached below as a guide, build an application that will allow a user to search for any song and then play that song.
- You will need three key pieces to your app.
- An audio player using the <audio> tag
- A form that allows a user to enter a song/artist etc title
- An area to display the results
- After the results are displayed, I should be able to click the image of any album and play the song associated with it.
